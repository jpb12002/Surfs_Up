# Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval 

## Overview of the Analysis
Our goal is to set up a Surf n' Shake shop in Hawaii, specifically Oahu, to sell surf supplies and ice cream. We need investor backing to open the shop and there is already an investor who is extremely interested. However, they are worried about the weather in this location and if our shop would be sustainable throughout the year. We performed analytics on weather data for Oahu for the summer month of June and the winter month of December to determine if the weather is stable enough in the area to support a consistent customer base.

- The average temperature for the months of June and December in Oahu are similar, at 75 degrees and 71 degrees, respectively. 
- The standard deviations for the months of June and December in Oahu are similar, at 3.26 degrees and 3.75 degrees, respectively.
- The minimum temperature in December was 56 degrees while the lowest temperature in June was 64 degrees. However, both months have similar maximum temperatures at 83 degrees in December and 85 degrees in June. 

## Summary
After performing our analysis of the Oahu weather data, we can see that the temperature is stable throughout the year in this location. The average temperature in the summer and the winter is not significantly different, staying in the low 70-degree range. We also determined that the spread of temperatures in both seasons is also similar, with no significant differences in the standard deviation. The main variation between the months being analyzed was that December had a significantly lower minimum temperature than June, with a difference of 8 degrees between months. However, the maximum temperature in the summer month of June was only 2 degrees warmer than the winter month of December, which again shows the stability of the temperature throughout the year. 

One additional query would be to gather the precipitation data for the month of June. Another additional query would be to gather the precipitation data for the month of December. Inclement weather, like rain, is another predictive factor for determining the demand for recreation and number of tourists in an area.

# Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval 

## Overview of the Analysis
Our goal is to set up a Surf n' Shake shop in Hawaii, specifically Oahu, to sell surf supplies and ice cream. We need investor backing to open up the shop and there is already an investor who is very interested. However, they are worried about the weather in this location and if our shop would be sustainable throughout the year. We performed analytics on weather data for Oahu for the summer month of June and the winter month of December to determine if the weather is stable enough in the area to support a consistent customer base.
